# Overview

Status: done

## Goal
- Add a left navigation layout for the unlocked workspace.
- Split existing dashboard features into separate views: portfolio (overview), risk, market, opportunities, backtest, insights, alerts, other, account.

## Non-goals
- Implement new business logic for placeholder modules (opportunities/backtest/insights/alerts/other).
- Introduce URL-based routing or deep linking.
- Change authentication or account creation flows.

## Notes
- Keep existing dashboard functionality intact; only reorganize UI by view.
