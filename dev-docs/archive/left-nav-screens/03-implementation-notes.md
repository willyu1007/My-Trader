# Implementation Notes

- Reworked `Dashboard` into a workspace shell with left navigation and view-specific rendering.
- Split portfolio/risk/market sections into their own views and added placeholder panels for remaining modules.
- Added sidebar, navigation, view header, and key/value styles in `styles.css` to support the new layout.
